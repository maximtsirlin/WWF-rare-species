      <h2 class="description__title">Species are important for several reasons</h2>
      <p class="description__paragraph">Rare species are important for several reasons. They provide unique genetic and
        ecological diversity and often play critical roles in maintaining the balance and stability of ecosystems. They
        also have cultural and aesthetic value and can be important sources of food, medicine, and other resources for
        local communities.
      </p>
      <p class="description__paragraph">
        Conservation efforts are crucial to protect and preserve rare species. These efforts may include habitat
        restoration and protection, captive breeding and reintroduction programs, and regulation of hunting and trade of
        rare species. In addition, public awareness and education can help promote understanding and appreciation of the
        importance of rare species and the need to conserve them.
        Some examples of rare species include the black rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard,
        mountain gorilla, Sumatran orangutan, and the California condor, among many others.</p>

          <div class="photos__paragraph">Rare species are species of plants, animals, or other organisms that are at
            risk of
            becoming extinct or have very small populations in their natural habitats. These species may be rare due to
            natural factors such as limited geographic range, low population densities, or specific ecological
            requirements.
            However, human activities, such as habitat loss, pollution, and overhunting, are often the main causes of
            species becoming rare.</div>
